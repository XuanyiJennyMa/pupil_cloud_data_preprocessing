# Aims and the built-up of scripts

## What are the scritps for?

In our project, we are very interested in the fixations in different parts of a manuscript and the saccades between each parts. We have many different kinds of manuscripts: 
+  pictures
+  pictures with description
+  texts with illustration
+  texts with paratexts

AOIs for each manuscript need to be defined. However, AOIs are easier to capture in some manuscripts than the others and sometimes there are multiple sets of AOIs that we are interested in for one manuscript.

![New folder names](Screenshot%202024-02-14%20153329.png)

However, this process is completely optional. You don't have to change your folder name as there are also codes prepared to the original long folder names.
