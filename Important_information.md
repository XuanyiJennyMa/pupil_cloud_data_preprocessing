# Aims and the built-up of scripts

## What are the scritps for?

In our project, we are very interested in the fixations in different parts of a manuscript and the saccades between each parts. We have many different kinds of manuscripts: 
1  pictures
2  pictures with description
3  texts with illustrationo
4  texts with paratexts











After downloading and extracting the data from the successful enrichment process of each reference picture, the original folder names are like this:

![Original folder names](Screenshot%202024-02-14%20153212.png)

I personally prefer a shorter folder name which still reminds me what this folder is about, so I changed the folder names into this:

![New folder names](Screenshot%202024-02-14%20153329.png)

However, this process is completely optional. You don't have to change your folder name as there are also codes prepared to the original long folder names.
