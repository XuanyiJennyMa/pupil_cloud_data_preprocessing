# The Guide for the usage of scripts

## Please read it before applying the scripts on your data

After downloading and extracting the data from the successful enrichment process of each reference picture, the original folder names are like this:

I personally prefer a shorter folder name which still reminds me what this folder is about, so I changed the folder names into this:

![New folder names](Screenshot%202024-02-14%20153329.png)

However, this process is completely optional. You don't have to change your folder name as there are also codes prepared to the original long folder names.
